## üß™ How to Run

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shashidhxr/deltax.git
cd deltax

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./deltax


# In backend/ (you have to run a backend which sends realtime updates in db via websocket on port 3000)
npm install
npm start

# In frontend/
npm install
npm run dev

Make sure your PostgreSQL instance is running and correctly configured.
```

## Development Roadmap
- Add OAuth 2.0 and mTLS support
- Prometheus-based metrics collection
- Real-time analytics & request tracing
- Multi-cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Replace WebSocket with gRPC streaming
